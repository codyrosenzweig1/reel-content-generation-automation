This project is a modular, end-to-end content generation pipeline that uses Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) to create short-form, voice-converted educational or humorous content. It builds on the RVC framework and integrates custom scripting, AI-generated dialogue, and voice cloning (e.g. Stewie and Peter Griffin) to automate content creation. The system supports command-line, Python, API, and Docker usage, and is designed to be scalable for platforms like Instagram. Development is ongoing, with features like cloud-based voice conversion and dynamic text overlay integration in progress.
