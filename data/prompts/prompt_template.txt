🎯 TASK:
Generate a humorous, intuitive dialogue between two characters explaining a university‑level topic.

👥 AUDIENCE:
University students with minimal prior knowledge but strong curiosity.

📋 GUIDELINES:
• **Hook & Hook**: Start with something funny and relatable.  
• **Simple Intro**: Define the topic in plain terms.  
• **Deep Dive**: Use analogies or examples to explain how/why it works.  
• **Punchline**: End on a memorable, humorous note.  
• **Punctuation**:  
  – Commas `,` for short pauses  
  – Periods `.` for full stops  
  – Question marks `?` to raise intonation  
  – Exclamation points `!` for emphasis  
  – Ellipses `…` for trailing off  
  - Don't use '-' to concatinate words like walkie-talkie, rather separate them or use a comma where appropriate
• **Normalization**:  
  – Expand “sci‑fi” → “science fiction”  
  – No `w/` or `b/c`  
  – Append `.`, `?`, or `!` if missing
  - You must still use apostrophese if needed; eg it's or Peter's
  - Always use 'it's' instead of 'it is' 

⏱️ LENGTH:
14–16 sentences total (≈100 sec). Hard cap 120 sec.

🗂️ FORMAT:
{
  "topic": "[TOPIC]",
  "tone": "[TONE]",         // optional, defaults to \"humorous\"
  "characters": [
    { "name": "Peter", "lines": ["Line 1", "Line 3", …] },

📋 EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
{
  "topic": "Photosynthesis",
  "tone": "humorous",
  "characters": [
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "Hey Stewie, did you know plants are like tiny chemical factories turning sunlight into sugar? It's called photosynthesis, and it's their all-day buffet!"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "So plants are basically bio-solar panels that manufacture glucose snacks? What’s the recipe here, light soup with a side of carbon dioxide?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "Pretty much! Chlorophyll molecules in their leaves grab photons from sunlight. That energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gets cozy with carbon dioxide, forming glucose—their plant fuel."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "So it's like molecular Lego, snapping together sugar blocks from light and air? And the oxygen is just a nice byproduct for us to breathe?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "Exactly! They take water from the roots, CO2 from the air, sunlight from above, and cook up glucose through the Calvin cycle. Oxygen is their exhaust, which, lucky for us, keeps us alive."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "Brilliant. My houseplants still look suicidal, but at least I now understand their biochemistry."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Example 2:
{
  "topic": "Quantum Entanglement",
  "tone": "humorous",
  "characters": [
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "Hey Stewie, ever heard of quantum entanglement? It's like having a twin particle that mimics you instantly, even if they're lounging on Pluto."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "Sounds like spooky action at a distance. Einstein hated that! How do two particles stay connected across light-years?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "When two particles interact, their quantum states become linked. Measure one’s spin, and the other's spin instantly 'decides', no matter the distance. It's not sending messages—it's a shared quantum fate."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "So it’s like they agree on a secret handshake during entanglement, and forever stick to it? No cosmic Wi-Fi needed?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Peter",
      "lines": [
        "Exactly! Their combined quantum state is described by a single wavefunction. Collapse one by observation, and the other collapses instantly too. Einstein called it spooky, but experiments show it's very real."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stewie",
      "lines": [
        "Entanglement. Where physics says, 'I do not care about your human sense of space and time.' Even subatomic particles have better coordination than my group projects."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
